mccal: simple desktop reminder calendar
=======================================

requires:
---------

- Perl, Perl::DateTime, Perl::Time::HiRes, bash

to install:
-----------

- copy the files addappointments, findappointment, remind,
  run_findapps.sh, and viewcal to a directory in your executable path
  (e.g., ~/bin).

- copy the file commonfuncs.pm to your "library" directory. If you are
  copying to a directory not visible to perl, you will have to
  explicitly add:

  BEGIN {
        push @INC, "<your library directory>";
  }

  to the top of the files: findappointment, remind.

- customise your window manager to run run_findapps.sh at startup.


user interface
--------------
1) addappointments

- writes an appointment entry to the calendar file

Usage: addappointments [file]
Entries must look like: [<weekly|biweekly|monthly|yearly> <N>]
                        [remind <N>]
                        [yyyy-mm-dd] HH:mm
                        [<text>[; command1; command2; ...]]

command1, command2, etc. are commands to execute upon the appointment
coming due (in addition to the popup gxmessage).

2) viewcal

- displays appointments

Usage:
viewcal [-f <calendar file>] [<year>|<month>|<week>|<today>|<tomorrow>|<yesterday>|<yyyy-mm-dd>|<yyyy-mm>|<yyyy>]

3) run_findapps.sh

- wrapper for findappointments (see below). Kills existing processes
  before starting a new one.

- call this in your window manager's initialization script.


"internal" files:
-----------------

1) commonfuncs.pm

- common functions used by all files

2) remind

- reminds the user of an appointment

3) findappointment

- checks calendar file periodically for due appointments
