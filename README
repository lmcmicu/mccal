mccal: simple reminder calendar
===============================

not a "visual" calendar by any stretch of the imagination. This
simple little program is mainly useful for giving you reminders, which
you can snooze (as often as you like) for 5, 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4
hours, or 1 day. None of the (at the time I wrote this) available
calendars for Linux/UNIX had this kind of snoozing functionality. This
is the main reason I wrote mccal.

When an appointment becomes due, the program will pop up a gxmessage
window with the appointment text, which you can then dismiss or snooze
as desired. The program also allows you to optionally indicate a set
of commands it should run at that time (e.g., emailing someone,
ringing a bell, etc.).

It would be easily possible to hack the code slightly to replace the
gxmessage reminder popup window with something different and/or more
(or less!) snazzy. In the future I will make this completely
customisable in a config file.

Other desirable features will also eventually implemented.


requires:
---------

- Perl, Perl::DateTime, Perl::Time::HiRes, bash, gxmessage.

to install:
-----------

- copy the files addappointments, findappointment, remind,
  run_findapps.sh, and viewcal to a directory in your executable path
  (e.g., ~/bin).

- copy the file commonfuncs.pm to your "library" directory. If you are
  copying to a directory not visible to perl, you will have to
  explicitly add:

  BEGIN {
        push @INC, "<your library directory>";
  }

  to the top of the files: findappointment, remind.

- customise your window manager to run run_findapps.sh at startup.


user interface
--------------
1) addappointments

- writes an appointment entry to the calendar file

Usage: addappointments [file]
Entries must look like: [<weekly|biweekly|monthly|yearly> <N>]
                        [remind <N>]
                        [yyyy-mm-dd] HH:mm
                        [<text>[; command1; command2; ...]]

command1, command2, etc. are commands to execute upon the appointment
coming due (in addition to the popup gxmessage).

2) viewcal

- displays appointments

Usage:
viewcal [-f <calendar file>] [<year>|<month>|<week>|<today>|<tomorrow>|<yesterday>|<yyyy-mm-dd>|<yyyy-mm>|<yyyy>]

3) run_findapps.sh

- wrapper for findappointments (see below). Kills existing processes
  before starting a new one.

- call this in your window manager's initialization script.

4) getmins

Usage: getmins NUMBER[m|h|d|w]

- handy extra tool to help in specyfying reminder times. Use like this:

$ echo "remind `getmins 24h` 2015-07-09 20:00 Office party"|addappointments 


"internal" files:
-----------------

1) commonfuncs.pm

- common functions used by all files

2) remind

- reminds the user of an appointment

3) findappointment

- checks calendar file periodically for due appointments
