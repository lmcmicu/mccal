HIGH PRIORITY:
--------------

- edit/cancel appointments. Similarly to the processed events file we can
also have a cancelled events file, and then viewcal and findappointment can
ignore event ids that are in that file.

ENHANCEMENTS:
-------------

- year should be optional in addappointments

- allow "every n <weeks|days|months|years>" or at the very least "bi-weekly"

- allow "text mode" instead of xmessage.

- allow "next month", "next week", etc. in viewcal

- viewcal should be able to take a date range argument

- multi line text in appointments.  Note viewcal should still only display headline.
